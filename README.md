# Lua Game Boy: The Assembler

who even knows what this is

the good:

- converts single instructions to machine code

the bad:

- has no notion of labels
- checks every instruction against hundreds of regexes
- might not entirely comply with bgb/no$gmb mnemonics
- it's only a module and not an executable script
